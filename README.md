This project explores the performance characteristics of sparse matrix-vector multiplication by implementing:

- Sequential and parallel implementations in CSR (Compressed Sparse Row) formats
- Parallel code developed using OpenMP with configurable thread scheduling
- Comprehensive benchmarking across matrices with varying sparsity patterns
- Performance analysis including scheduling strategy evaluation and bottleneck identification
